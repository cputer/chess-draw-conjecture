**Dataset, code, and LaTeX source for the paper:**
*"Draw Inevitability in Chess Under Perfect Play: A Formal Conjecture and Theoretical Analysis"*
by **Nikolai Nedovodin** (2025)

---

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository contains all materials associated with the paper, including:

* **LaTeX source** of the full manuscript (`main.tex` and `references.bib`)
* **Figures** (TikZ/PGFPlots) and diagram sources
* **Python scripts** for empirical analysis
* **Dataset links** for 4 million engine self-play games
* **Reproducibility protocol** for falsifying or supporting the conjecture

The project presents:

* A **formal game-theoretic framework** for the draw inevitability conjecture
* The **Draw Stability Index (DSI)** metric
* Lemmas on **Repetition Safety** and **Fortress Basin Stability**
* A large-scale multi-engine dataset
* A reproducible falsifiability protocol

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The **4-million-game self-play dataset** is too large to include in this repository.
It is hosted externally (link forthcoming) and contains:

* **Engines:** Stockfish 16 NNUE, Lc0 v0.30, Komodo Dragon 3
* **Time Control:** 10+0.1
* **Openings:** 500 ECO-coded positions
* **Adjudication:** Syzygy 7-man tablebases
* **Format:** PGN + JSON metadata
