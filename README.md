## ðŸ“„ Abstract
We revisit the long-standing conjecture that classical chess is a theoretical draw.  
We present an expanded formal framework, introducing **draw-attractor basins** and a novel metric, the **Draw Stability Index (DSI)**.  
We provide formalized lemmas with proofs establishing sufficient conditions for a draw: **Repetition Safety** and **Fortress Basin Stability**.  
Our empirical section includes a large-scale, multi-engine self-play dataset (4M games) with a public release protocol.  
We formalize a **falsifiability protocol** with reproducible parameters, integrating perspectives from chess theory, game theory, and AI research toward a constructive resolution of the problem.
